# Herdr integration

## Compatibility

- Herdr `0.7.5+`
- Pi `0.84.x`
- Required environment inside a managed pane: `HERDR_ENV=1`, `HERDR_PANE_ID`, `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`

`herdr integration install pi` improves Herdr's native Pi lifecycle/session detection but is not required for spawning `--kind pi`.

## Launch sequence

1. Validate Herdr environment and control plane.
2. Open a placement with `--no-focus`: a **new tab** in the current workspace (default, no `workspace_group`), or create/split a grouped workspace.
3. Start a unique Pi agent with `herdr agent start ... --kind pi --pane ... -- <argv>`.
4. Submit the task with atomic `herdr agent prompt`.
5. Report `task_id`, `task_phase`, `task_agent`, and `task_parent` metadata from source `pi-subagents`.
6. Start `agent wait`; use its settled/blocked status to trigger JSONL reconciliation.
7. Show a Herdr toast when the task settles.
8. Verify socket, pane and terminal identity before cleanup.

## Failure policy

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| not inside Herdr | auto may use tmux/SDK |
| Herdr binary absent | auto may fall back |
| socket/server transient outage | bounded classified retry, then visible failure |
| invalid CLI arguments/permanent error | no retry |
| status `unknown` | uncertain, never success |
| wait/subscription interrupted | reconnect through periodic reconciliation |
| pane ID reused with different terminal ID | ownership mismatch; do not control/close |

## Grouping

Groups are namespaced by socket, parent pane, group label, and layout mode. **Without** `workspace_group`, a task opens a new tab in the current workspace (no owned workspace). **With** `workspace_group` (dedicated mode), the first task creates an owned workspace root. One task fills it, two are side-by-side, three use one full-height column and two half-height panes, and four form a 2x2 grid. Additional tasks recursively split the largest remaining cell. Persisted handles retain workspace ownership for restoration and cleanup.

Set `herdr_layout: "attached"` together with `workspace_group` to keep the current parent pane as the left 50% and grid children within the right 50%. The first child is a right split from the parent at ratio `0.5`; later children split only child panes. Attached handles never own the parent workspace, so intermediate and final cleanup close child panes only. Tmux and SDK execution accept but ignore this HerdR-specific option.

## Coexistence with `@ogulcancelik/pi-herdr`

This package registers `task` and `task_control`. It does not register generic `herdr_layout`, `herdr_pane`, or `herdr_agent`, so both packages can be installed together.

## Optional attention broker

The plugin in `herdr-plugin/attention-broker/` listens to settled/blocked/exited events, persists and deduplicates them by named-session socket, and atomically prompts the supervisor named `Root`. It is a wake-up bridge only; the task kernel and Pi JSONL remain authoritative.

```bash
herdr plugin link ./node_modules/@minhduydev/pi-subagents/herdr-plugin/attention-broker
```

Configure `root_name` and `dedupe_window_ms` in the plugin config directory when needed.
